"""
The engine's gates are on the path that points it at a customer.

Six subsystems were built into the engine -- the assurance tuple and change
gate, the authorization-to-effect ledger, the extension lifecycle gate, the
decision twin and remediation replay, route attestation, and the incident
evidence pack -- and a grep of this repository for "assurance",
"/api/extensions", "/api/authority" and "/api/evidence" returned nothing.
The change gate was consulted only by its own HTTP route and its own tests,
so a deployment whose model, tools, routes, policies, hooks and permissions
had all changed since approval ran every scan with nothing objecting.

extensions/gate.py names the realistic failure as "the engine ran for a week
with a changed scanner and nobody read the endpoint". That was not a risk,
it was the shipped configuration.
