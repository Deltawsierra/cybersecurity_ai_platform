"""
The defender middleware is a gateway: it asks the engine for a decision on
every request and allows the request when it gets none. That default is
correct, but it used to be silent, so a wrong header or a stopped engine
switched the defensive layer off with nothing in the logs.

These tests need no engine. They use Django's RequestFactory rather than a
hand-rolled fake, because the body handling is where the defects were and a
stub carrying `body = b""` cannot reach it.
